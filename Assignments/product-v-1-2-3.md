## Work Planning

Tips:
1. **Tip 1: Utilize each Wednesday class as a Sprint Planning & Retrospective Meeting** - Each Wed class will start with a brief lesson and then you'll have 90 minutes to meet with your team.

Complete the old sprint board by checking all tickets and moving incomplete ones over to the next sprint board. Then estimate the tickets that the PM have moved into the board ahead of meeting. Go over what was completed, what went well not if it didn’t go so well, but double check how everyone felt. Anyone feel overloaded on work? Anything the PM could have done differently?
