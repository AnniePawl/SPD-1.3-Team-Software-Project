  - **In Class Activities**
    - *"Cold email" message feedback* - give feedback on a variety of "cold email" messages that other students have written to industry contacts. A cold email is a message to someone you've have never talked with before. Sending cold emails is a critical skill to finding advisors for projects and applying to jobs.
    - *Thank you message* - Write a thank you message to your previous industry contact. Follow best practices from class to increase the likelihood that industry contacts will want to continue advising in the future.
    - *Reach out to an industry advisor* - find an industry contact whom you'd like their advice on for your project. This could be someone who is creating a similar product, has expert in your domain or technologies you are using.
  - **After Class** - 1) send a message out to the industry contact you mentioned  2) continue working on your sprint
