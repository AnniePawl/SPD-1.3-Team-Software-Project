## Revisiting Point Estimations

- Point estimations are a way for engineers to estimate how long something will take to finish
- They're not meant to be held against you, it’s a learning opportunity, and they will help you and your team grow
- They're a life-skill: you will do this wherever you work as a software engineer, from startups to corporations

### Why should I do them?

- They're not binding time constraints, they're guesses on how hard a task is to complete
- They're used to help track how much your team can get done in a sprint. Knowing how many points your team can get done in a sprint is known as **velocity**, and is what engineering teams use to know how much work to pull into a sprint
- These also helo you track how much you can get done, as well as how to eyeball how difficult something is
- It will take a while to get good at it. The more you do it, the better at it you'll get.

### How do I do it?

Story points are typically chosen using the Fibonacci sequence, as it’s easier to pick an estimate than with a linear sequence. For example, it's easier to pick 5 or 8 instead of 5, 6, 7, or 8.

Typically we use the following for point numbers. Where 0.5 (yes it's not Fibonacci, just go with it!) is a dead simple task, and 13 is a really hard task that will most likely take longer than a sprint to do. Anything 13 or higher should be broken up into smaller, more digestable tickets.

Numbers typically used:
- 0.5
- 1
- 3
- 5
- 8
- 13
