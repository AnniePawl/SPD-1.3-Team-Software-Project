# SPD 1.3 Team Software Project

## Course Description

Think Big. After winter break, core curriculum focuses on a big group project with teams of 4-5 engineers. You'll specialize in a particular role (mobile, front end, back end, devices, etc) and execute an ambitious project to impact the world. Previous projects include:
  - A website, designed in partnership with the White House, to educate and connect underserved communities to the Internet.
  - An online marketplace to find and purchase IOT home appliances.
  - A "smart curriculum" that creates tests off of student work.

Your team will dive deep into the nuance of an industry, talk with experts in the field, and create something meaningful. We'll cover organizational psychology research on what makes teams thrive. You'll get hands on experience navigating team dynamics and troubleshooting common communication challenges. SPD 1.3 culminates with Demo Night presentations of shipped product. It's a stellar opportunity to showcase your work to the larger Make School network and share what you've learned.

## Resources

- **User Interviews** - user interviews help you understand and validate user needs. Here are user interview [best practices](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xtUGbErF315eKkvVAstTnWzoXLmpygtf6YGTEMYwg_A/edit#slide=id.p) and a [template script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uRRKejC3Ullk5vdw9P1SHmE56CGkekH2dIaoBV9ISeM/edit)
- **Best Practices for User Narratives, Wireframe, Entity Relationship Diagram** - see [best practice articles, videos, and slides](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uCxdv8N0TltGNS1YLOS8SkD0uLcir0Wg2I9pxS_PL_w/edit#) See [class slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ALBDn3bIycimyvnB6fEOAMadDOCA4wmoOO9Z-lpBRsM/edit#slide=id.g3e71f5355a_0_26) here.
- **Sprint Planning Meetings (1 hour, weekly)** - *[Meeting Agenda Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n6IDYJ9jW2lWaTu5uf7qXEd3ihgQIByxsr-4RHjldBI/edit#heading=h.xffidahcubfs)*. Led by the PM. Team checks their roadmap and evaluate teams’ needs to decide what goes into the next sprint, and assign tasks. Teams can use [planning poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker) to estimate task effort. Everything is logged into Trello. You can copy this [Sprint Planning Trello Board template](https://trello.com/b/ftyBKJb3/eng-sprint-board-template).
- **Sprint Retrospective (½ hour, weekly)** - *[Meeting Agenda Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n6IDYJ9jW2lWaTu5uf7qXEd3ihgQIByxsr-4RHjldBI/edit#heading=h.10t6cnudbcpw)*. Complete the old sprint board by checking all tickets and moving incomplete ones over to the next sprint board. Then estimate the tickets that the PM have moved into the board ahead of meeting. Go over what was completed, what went well not if it didn’t go so well, but double check how everyone felt. Anyone feel overloaded on work? Anything the PM could have done differently?

## Evaluation
[MAKE SPECIFIC TO YOUR COURSE SO IT IS SUPER CLEAR]
To pass this course you must meet the following requirements:

- Complete all required tutorials
- Pass all projects according to the associated project rubric
- Pass the final summative assessment >=75%
- Actively participate in class and abide by the attendance policy
- Make up all classwork from all absences

## Attendance
Just like any job, attendance at Make School is required and a key component of your success. Attendance is being onsite from 9:30 to 5:30 each day, attending all scheduled sessions including classes, huddles, coaching and school meetings, and working in the study labs when not in a scheduled session. Working onsite allows you to learn with your peers, have access to support from TAs, instructors and others, and is vital to your learning.

Attendance requirements for scheduled sessions are:
- No more than two no call no shows per term in any scheduled session.
- No more than four excused absences per term in any scheduled session.

Failure to meet these requirements will result in a PIP (Participation Improvement Plan).  Failure to improve after the PIP is cause for not being allowed to continue at Make School.
